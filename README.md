# HSParty

# The goal :
Make ourselves the H1Z1 we always wanted but never had, focusing the CombatZone Mode first as an experiment.
Create a community movement & motivation to change the current gaming industry with lazy/unaware gaming studios about what players wants.
Push forward the FreeToPlay model as a new gaming standard.

# People we need : 
Everybody is more than welcome to help on this project and futher ones.
Any level of experience is always needed, so feel free to join the cause and help us with your personnal touchs, they will always be appreciated.
